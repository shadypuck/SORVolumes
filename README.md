# SORVolumes: Volumes of Parabola-Line Solids of Revolution

In this paper, written by me as a Junior in high school, I explore different proofs of the formula for the solid of revolution created by rotating the parabola, y=ax^2, about the axis of rotation, y=bx. More details can be found in the Abstract of the PDF.

Included are the PDF, the .tex file necessary to generate the PDF, and a folder of images that are either referenced in the .tex file or were my original drafts of those used. The .blend's ([Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org/)) used to generate the images in the folder is also included in the folder.
